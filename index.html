<!-- Woah! This is unusual, otherwise my kao wouldn't know how to check this code,
unless it's someone else showing her this. I started making this at valentine's day since
I was not able to come up with better ideas and at the time I couldn't deliver the roses to her house,
but she doesn't know that. Regardless, I love my kao, and this is little present made from my free time
hopefully she loves it. PS. I will deliver the roses in person!! -->
